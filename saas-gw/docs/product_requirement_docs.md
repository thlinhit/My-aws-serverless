# Product Requirements Document - API Gateway Service

## Problem Statement
Organizations need a secure, efficient, and standardized way to expose backend functionality through APIs. Current solutions often require extensive manual configuration, lack proper security controls, or are difficult to maintain across environments.

## Project Goals
This project aims to provide a template for quickly provisioning secure, API-key protected AWS API Gateways that connect to Lambda functions using the Serverless Framework v3.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **API Gateway Configuration**
   - Deploy an API Gateway through infrastructure as code
   - Support API key authentication for all endpoints
   - Create and manage endpoints through the Serverless Framework v3
   - Enable CORS support for web applications

2. **Lambda Integration**
   - Connect API Gateway endpoints to Lambda functions
   - Support Python 3.12 runtime for Lambda functions
   - Enable proper logging and error handling

3. **Security**
   - Enforce API key authentication
   - Implement proper IAM permissions using least privilege principles
   - Secure API responses with appropriate headers

4. **Deployment**
   - Support multiple deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Automate deployment with CI/CD pipeline (future enhancement)
   - Allow easy cleanup of deployed resources

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Minimize Lambda cold start times
   - Optimize API Gateway response times

2. **Reliability**
   - Implement error handling and logging
   - Support for easy diagnostics

3. **Scalability**
   - Auto-scale with demand
   - Handle concurrent requests appropriately

4. **Maintainability**
   - Follow best practices for Serverless Framework configuration
   - Organize code for readability and extensibility
   - Provide comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully deploy an API Gateway with API key authentication
2. Connect to a Python 3.12 Lambda function
3. Successfully handle POST requests to the endpoint
4. Return a properly formatted JSON response
5. Secure the API with proper authentication and headers
6. Document the deployment and usage process

## Out of Scope
1. Database integration
2. User authentication beyond API keys
3. Complex business logic within Lambda functions
4. Front-end implementation
5. CI/CD pipeline implementation (will be addressed in future phases)

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Setup basic API Gateway with Lambda integration and API key authentication (current phase)
- **Phase 2**: Add additional endpoints and business logic (future)
- **Phase 3**: Implement CI/CD pipeline and automated testing (future)
- **Phase 4**: Add monitoring and alerting (future)
