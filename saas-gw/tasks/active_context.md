# Active Context - API Gateway Service

## Current Focus
The current focus is on enhancing the API Gateway service with CloudFront integration to improve performance, security, and global reach. The implementation includes an API key-authenticated endpoint fronted by CloudFront that returns a simple "HELLO" response.

## Recent Changes

### Infrastructure Configuration
- Created serverless.yml with API Gateway and Lambda configuration
- Configured API key authentication for API Gateway
- Set up CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Defined packaging configuration to optimize deployment package size
- Added CloudFront distribution to front the API Gateway
- Configured proper header forwarding for API keys

### Lambda Implementation
- Created a basic Lambda handler in Python 3.12
- Implemented proper logging and response formatting
- Added detailed comments to explain functionality
- Set up error handling structure

### Project Structure
- Organized files according to best practices
- Created documentation in Memory Files format
- Set up npm scripts for simplified deployment
- Added CloudFront-specific documentation and commands

## Development Environment
- Using Node.js and npm for package management
- Using Python 3.12 for Lambda function development
- Using AWS CLI with tx-sandbox profile for deployment
- Using Serverless Framework v3 for infrastructure as code
- Using CloudFront for API distribution

## Current Status
- All core files have been created
- Initial implementation is complete
- CloudFront integration is configured
- Ready for deployment and testing
- Documentation has been updated to include CloudFront usage

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the implementation with CloudFront to the development environment
2. Test the API endpoint through both direct API Gateway and CloudFront
3. Verify Lambda execution and response formatting
4. Review and enhance error handling
5. Consider adding request validation
6. Explore custom domain configuration for CloudFront

## Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- **Serverless Framework v3**: Chosen for its robust API Gateway and Lambda configuration capabilities and community support
- **Python 3.12**: Selected for Lambda runtime due to its performance and developer productivity
- **API Key Authentication**: Selected as a simple authentication mechanism for initial implementation
- **CloudFront**: Added to provide improved performance, security, and global reach

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single Lambda Function**: Keeping the initial implementation simple with a single function
- **CORS Enabled**: Supporting cross-origin requests for browser-based clients
- **Structured Logging**: Implementing proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Optimized Packaging**: Configuring serverless.yml to exclude unnecessary files
- **CloudFront Integration**: Fronting API Gateway with CloudFront for performance benefits

### Implementation Details
- **Response Format**: Using standardized JSON response format
- **Error Handling**: Setting up structure for consistent error responses
- **Deployment Strategy**: Using environment variables and stage parameters for different environments
- **CloudFront Configuration**: Forwarding API keys and other necessary headers to the origin

## Open Questions
- Should additional validation be added to the Lambda function?
- Is the current logging level appropriate for production use?
- Should we consider implementing usage plans for API keys?
- How should we approach automated testing for the API?
- Would a custom domain name for CloudFront be beneficial?

## Blockers
None at this time.

## Priorities
1. Deploy and verify the current implementation with CloudFront
2. Enhance error handling and validation
3. Improve documentation with usage examples
4. Consider additional security measures
5. Explore CloudFront-specific optimizations
