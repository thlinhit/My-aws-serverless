# Product Requirement Document - Spring Boot AppSync Integration

## Project Overview
This project provides a Spring Boot application that integrates with AWS AppSync GraphQL API using OpenFeign. It serves as a middleware service that allows clients to interact with AppSync GraphQL APIs through a simplified REST interface.

## Key Objectives
1. Provide a REST API endpoint that transforms client requests into GraphQL queries
2. Handle authentication and security for AppSync API calls
3. Implement robust error handling with domain-specific error codes
4. Support configurable timeouts and retries for resilient communication
5. Maintain clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns

## Target Users
- Developers building applications that need to access AWS AppSync
- Services that require GraphQL data but prefer to use REST interfaces
- Systems that need a proxy service to handle authentication and formatting of GraphQL queries

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **REST API Endpoint**
   - Provide a single POST endpoint at `/api/graphql` that accepts GraphQL queries
   - Support full GraphQL syntax including queries, mutations, and variables

2. **GraphQL Request Processing**
   - Transform incoming JSON requests into properly formatted GraphQL requests
   - Support operation name specification for query identification
   - Enable variable passing to parameterize GraphQL queries

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Provide detailed error messages and domain-specific error codes
   - Log all errors with proper context for troubleshooting

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Configure appropriate timeouts for API requests
   - Support retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Enable request/response compression for efficiency

2. **Security**
   - Securely manage API keys for AppSync authentication
   - Support environment-specific configuration
   - Validate incoming requests to prevent injection attacks

3. **Scalability**
   - Design for stateless operation to allow horizontal scaling
   - Configure connection pools appropriately for high throughput

4. **Maintainability**
   - Follow clean architecture principles
   - Separate interface from implementation
   - Provide comprehensive exception handling

## Success Criteria
- Successfully execute GraphQL queries against AWS AppSync
- Handle and properly report errors with appropriate status codes
- Maintain response times under 500ms for typical queries
- Support configurable timeout and retry settings
- Provide consistent error handling across all failure modes

## Out of Scope
- GraphQL schema generation or validation
- Complex authentication mechanisms beyond API key
- Caching of GraphQL responses
- GraphQL subscription support

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Core functionality with basic error handling
- Phase 2: Enhanced error reporting and logging
- Phase 3: Performance optimizations and monitoring
- Phase 4: Production hardening and documentation
