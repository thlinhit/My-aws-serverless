- [ ] Create usage examples

### Planned Tasks

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Implement request/response compression
- [ ] Configure metrics collection

#### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add input validation for GraphQL queries
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CORS settings
- [ ] Add request logging for audit purposes

#### Operational Features
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting for error conditions
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern

#### Deployment
- [ ] Create Dockerfile

- [ ] Configure AWS deployment
- [ ] Set up production logging

## Known Issues

### High Priority
- None currently identified

### Medium Priority
- ~~AppSync connection doesn't handle network transient errors well~~ Fixed with retry mechanism and better error handling
- Error messages from AppSync not parsed into structured format

### Low Priority
- No support for GraphQL subscriptions
- Limited GraphQL schema validation

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. âœ“ Complete integration testing
2. Finish API documentation
3. ~~Address medium priority issues~~ Partially addressed with network error handling
4. Set up a Docker environment for local testing

### Medium Term (1-2 Months)
1. Implement performance optimizations
2. Add security enhancements
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Create deployment pipeline

### Long Term (3+ Months)
1. Add support for additional AppSync authentication methods
2. Implement caching layer for frequently used queries
3. Create client SDK for simplified integration
4. Add GraphQL subscription support
